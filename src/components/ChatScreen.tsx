Can hold their head up and is stable when supported to sit\n2. Frequently puts hands or toys in their mouth\n3. Watches with interest as adults eat\n4. The 'tongue-thrust reflex' that pushes food out has decreased\n5. Seems unsatisfied with only milk (increased feeding, seems hungry)\n\n---\n\n🔹 **How to Start the First Solid Foods**\n\n✅ **Initial Stage (4-6 months)**\n- Start with one meal a day, one spoonful at a time\n- Rice cereal or soft vegetables like pumpkin, sweet potato, potato\n- To check for allergies, feed **one ingredient for 3 days**\n- Consistency: Watery (10x porridge)\n\n✅ **Middle Stage (7-8 months)**\n- Two meals a day\n- Grains + vegetables + protein (beef, chicken breast, tofu, fish)\n- Consistency: Like yogurt (7x porridge)\n\n✅ **Late Stage (9-11 months)**\n- Three meals a day\n- Various ingredient combinations\n- Consistency: Like soft rice (5x porridge)\n- Introduce finger foods\n\n---\n\n🔹 **Precautions**\n\n❌ **Foods to avoid before 1 year:**\n- Honey (risk of botulism)\n- Cow's milk (difficult to digest)\n- Nuts, popcorn (choking hazard)\n- Salt, sugar, seasonings (burden on kidneys)\n\n⚠️ **Allergy-prone foods:**\n- Eggs, milk, wheat, peanuts, fish, shellfish, soy\n- Introduce these **one at a time**, in **small amounts**.\n\n---\n\n🔹 **Principles of Progressing with Solid Foods**\n\n1. **Slowly**: Don't rush, go at your baby's pace\n2. **Regularly**: Give food at similar times each day\n3. **Variously**: Let them experience various tastes and textures\n4. **Don't force**: If they refuse, try again later\n5. **Continue milk/formula**: Continue breastfeeding/formula until they are used to solid foods\n\n---\n\n🔹 **When to consult a doctor**\n\n- Does not accept solid foods at all after 6 months\n- Allergic reactions like vomiting, diarrhea, rash\n- Weight gain stops or decreases\n- Persistently fussy or shows strong refusal\n\n---\n\nIn summary,\nit is best to start solid foods around **6 months of age**, when the baby is ready.\nStart slowly with one ingredient at a time, and carefully watch for allergic reactions.`;

Put them down before they are fully asleep**\nThis is the hardest part, but try to put the baby down when they are drowsy.\n\n💖 **A word from Mom AI**\n"Sleep training is not a war, it's 'trust training'."`;

But it's okay — refusing solid food at this stage is **a part of development that almost every baby goes through**.\n\n🍼 **1. First, "refusal" is a sign of growth**\n\nAround 8 months, babies are at a stage where they can **"express what they want and don't want."**\nIn other words, refusing solid food is not just about taste, but the beginning of their autonomy, "I'll decide!"
Viewing this stage positively is the first step 🌱\n\n🍎 **2. Don't force-feed, show them a "joyful table"**\n\nIf the baby is tense or anxious at the table, they'll shut their mouth even tighter.\nSo the atmosphere is important.\n\n✅ Show them you and your partner eating together at the table.\n✅ React brightly, "This is delicious~!" to spark their curiosity.\n✅ If they refuse once, it's okay to take a break and try again in 30 minutes.\n\n💬 Changing it from "feeding time" to "mealtime together" greatly reduces resistance.\n\n🥄 **3. Try changing the texture, temperature, or utensils**\n\nHalf the reason babies refuse solid food is the 'texture.'\n\nThey dislike it if it's too watery or too thick.\n\nThey also dislike it if it's too hot or too cold.\n👉 Try making it lukewarm, and switch to a thin, soft spoon.\n\nAlso, some babies prefer to touch or feed themselves with their hands rather than being spoon-fed.\nIt's okay if it gets a little messy — exploration is part of learning to eat 💕\n\n🥕 **4. Add a 'twist' to familiar ingredients**\n\nFor example,\n\nAdding a fragrant ingredient like pumpkin, apple, or broccoli to their usual rice porridge, or\n\nA slight change in texture (mashing it more coarsely) can make a difference.\n\n🌤️ **5. Try when they are hungry, but not tired**\n\nAnyone would hate it if you try to feed them when they are too tired or right after waking up.\n\nRight after waking up from a nap,\n\n1-2 hours after a milk feeding,\n\nWhen they are a little hungry after active play\nare the times with the highest success rate ✨\n\n❤️ **A word from Mom AI**\n\n"No child who doesn't eat now will not eat forever."
It's okay if they don't eat for a day or two.\nWhat's important is to make sure the baby doesn't dislike the 'experience of eating.'\n\nOnce the baby regains interest in food, they'll start "suddenly eating well" as if by promise 😊\nDon't be impatient; building a "joyful meal experience" is the answer.`;

      if (lowerQuestion.includes('stress') || lowerQuestion.includes('hard') || lowerQuestion.includes('tired')) {
        return `💬 "Is there a way to relieve parenting stress?"

Honestly... how could there not be.
The sound of a baby crying all day, spilled baby food, not napping,
and in the meantime, cooking and doing laundry.
When you see the quiet house after putting the baby to sleep, you think "Finally..." but then you worry about tomorrow. I know that feeling all too well 😔

🌤️ **1. It's enough to be a "good enough mom," not a "perfect mom"**

There's no such thing as perfect parenting.
A baby crying, not eating, waking up at night is not because mom did something wrong, but just a part of the baby's growth process.
It's okay to be a little less than perfect —
the fact that mom is enduring is love itself. 💖

🫖 **2. Make a very short 'me time'**

Even 10 minutes is fine.

Have a cup of coffee while the baby naps ☕

Listen to a song with earphones in 🎧

Open a window and take a deep breath of fresh air 🌿

That short 10 minutes gives you the strength to get through the day.
The key to stress relief is not "escape" but **"breathing."**

💬 **3. Be sure to 'voice' your feelings**

Parenting can be isolating.
So you need a space where you can say, "I'm having a hard time."
To your husband, to a friend, or to other moms with the same worries.
The moment you say it,
you feel a sense of relief, "I'm not the only one."

💞 **4. And also... come to the ToDoc community**

There, you'll find real moms who have struggled just like you today.
Someone talks about succeeding with baby food today,
someone talks about their baby who cried all night finally sleeping.

Sometimes, a single comment saying "Me too" is the biggest comfort. 🌙

❤️ **A word from Mom AI**

Me, you, all of us are learning as we endure a little at a time."

When things are tough, be sure to stop by ToDoc and leave even a small story.`;
