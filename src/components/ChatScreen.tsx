Ear pain (possible otitis media)\n2. Abdominal pain, constipation, gas, or other digestive issues\n3. Gum pain (teething)\n4. Environmental factors like being too hot, thirsty, or sleepy\n5. Early stages of an infection\n\n---\n\n🔹 **Check these now**\n- Does the child make eye contact and respond?\n- Can the child be soothed?\n- Is the child drinking water or breast milk well?\n- Is breathing fast or difficult?\n\n---\n\n🔹 **When to go to the hospital**\n- Temperature of 37.5°C or higher persists for more than 6 hours\n- Crying does not stop for more than 3 hours\n- Refusal to take fluids\n- Lethargy, paleness, rash, vomiting, difficulty breathing\n\n---\n\n🔹 **Home care**\n- Remove one layer of clothing\n- Keep the room cool (22~24°C)\n- Wipe the body with lukewarm water\n- Offer water or breast milk frequently\n- Check temperature every 1-2 hours\n\n---\n\nIn summary,\na temperature of 37.5°C itself is not dangerous, but **if the crying continues, you must identify the cause**. If there is refusal to eat, lethargy, or breathing problems, **seek immediate medical attention**.`;

Can hold their head up and is stable when supported to sit\n2. Frequently puts hands or toys in their mouth\n3. Watches with interest as adults eat\n4. The 'tongue-thrust reflex' that pushes food out has decreased\n5. Seems unsatisfied with only milk (increased feeding, seems hungry)\n\n---\n\n🔹 **How to Start the First Solid Foods**\n\n✅ **Initial Stage (4-6 months)**\n- Start with one meal a day, one spoonful at a time\n- Rice cereal or soft vegetables like pumpkin, sweet potato, potato\n- To check for allergies, feed **one ingredient for 3 days**\n- Consistency: Watery (10x porridge)\n\n✅ **Middle Stage (7-8 months)**\n- Two meals a day\n- Grains + vegetables + protein (beef, chicken breast, tofu, fish)\n- Consistency: Like yogurt (7x porridge)\n\n✅ **Late Stage (9-11 months)**\n- Three meals a day\n- Various ingredient combinations\n- Consistency: Like soft rice (5x porridge)\n- Introduce finger foods\n\n---\n\n🔹 **Precautions**\n\n❌ **Foods to avoid before 1 year:**\n- Honey (risk of botulism)\n- Cow's milk (difficult to digest)\n- Nuts, popcorn (choking hazard)\n- Salt, sugar, seasonings (burden on kidneys)\n\n⚠️ **Allergy-prone foods:**\n- Eggs, milk, wheat, peanuts, fish, shellfish, soy\n- Introduce these **one at a time**, in **small amounts**.\n\n---\n\n🔹 **Principles of Progressing with Solid Foods**\n\n1. **Slowly**: Don't rush, go at your baby's pace\n2. **Regularly**: Give food at similar times each day\n3. **Variously**: Let them experience various tastes and textures\n4. **Don't force**: If they refuse, try again later\n5. **Continue milk/formula**: Continue breastfeeding/formula until they are used to solid foods\n\n---\n\n🔹 **When to consult a doctor**\n\n- Does not accept solid foods at all after 6 months\n- Allergic reactions like vomiting, diarrhea, rash\n- Weight gain stops or decreases\n- Persistently fussy or shows strong refusal\n\n---\n\nIn summary,\nit is best to start solid foods around **6 months of age**, when the baby is ready.\nStart slowly with one ingredient at a time, and carefully watch for allergic reactions.`;

Tidy up the daily routine before bedtime**\n\nIt's important to give the baby a signal that "it's time to sleep."\nFor example,\n\nBath → Feeding → Dim lights → Lullaby → Hug → Put to bed\n\nRepeating this in the same order at the same time every day helps the baby's body remember the routine.\n"Ah, this order means it's time to sleep."
\n🌙 **2. Put them down before they are fully asleep**\n\nThis is the hardest part for many moms 😅\nBut the point is to put the baby down when they are drowsy (about 70-80% asleep).\nThis way, you can gradually reduce the habit of **"only falling asleep in mom's arms"** and build their ability to fall asleep on their own.\n\nOf course, they might cry at first.\nWhen that happens, don't pick them up right away.\n\nFirst, reassure them with your voice, "It's okay, mommy is here."
\n💤 **3. Training should be 'consistent' rather than 'strict'**\n\nIf you try it one day and go back to holding them to sleep the next, the baby gets confused.\nSo the key is not "strictness" but **"consistency."**\nOnce you start, try to be consistent for 3-4 days.\nUsually, you'll see a change within a week.\n\n🍼 **4. Gradually reduce night feedings**\n\nFor an 8-month-old, 0-1 night feedings are enough.\nWhen practicing falling asleep without feeding, try patting their back or holding their hand instead.\n\n🌤️ **5. Practice 'sleeping well' during the day too**\n\nNight sleep training is much easier when the nap routine is also established.\nIf they sleep too long during the day, they won't be sleepy at night, and if they don't get enough naps, they'll be overtired and fussy.\n2-3 naps totaling 3-4 hours is appropriate.\n\n💖 **A word from Mom AI**\n\n"Sleep training is not a war, it's 'trust training'."\nWhile the baby learns to sleep alone, mom needs to keep letting them know, "I'm right here."
\nAfter a few days, the moment will come when the baby who cried every night quietly falls asleep.\nThe peace you feel then... it's truly moving 😌`;

But it's okay — refusing solid food at this stage is **a part of development that almost every baby goes through**.\n\n🍼 **1. First, "refusal" is a sign of growth**\n\nAround 8 months, babies are at a stage where they can **"express what they want and don't want."**\nIn other words, refusing solid food is not just about taste, but the beginning of their autonomy, "I'll decide!"
Viewing this stage positively is the first step 🌱\n\n🍎 **2. Don't force-feed, show them a "joyful table"**\n\nIf the baby is tense or anxious at the table, they'll shut their mouth even tighter.\nSo the atmosphere is important.\n\n✅ Show them you and your partner eating together at the table.\n✅ React brightly, "This is delicious~!" to spark their curiosity.\n✅ If they refuse once, it's okay to take a break and try again in 30 minutes.\n\n💬 Changing it from "feeding time" to "mealtime together" greatly reduces resistance.\n\n🥄 **3. Try changing the texture, temperature, or utensils**\n\nHalf the reason babies refuse solid food is the 'texture.'\n\nThey dislike it if it's too watery or too thick.\n\nThey also dislike it if it's too hot or too cold.\n👉 Try making it lukewarm, and switch to a thin, soft spoon.\n\nAlso, some babies prefer to touch or feed themselves with their hands rather than being spoon-fed.\nIt's okay if it gets a little messy — exploration is part of learning to eat 💕\n\n🥕 **4. Add a 'twist' to familiar ingredients**\n\nFor example,\n\nAdding a fragrant ingredient like pumpkin, apple, or broccoli to their usual rice porridge, or\n\nA slight change in texture (mashing it more coarsely) can make a difference.\n\n🌤️ **5. Try when they are hungry, but not tired**\n\nAnyone would hate it if you try to feed them when they are too tired or right after waking up.\n\nRight after waking up from a nap,\n\n1-2 hours after a milk feeding,\n\nWhen they are a little hungry after active play\nare the times with the highest success rate ✨\n\n❤️ **A word from Mom AI**\n\n"No child who doesn't eat now will not eat forever."
It's okay if they don't eat for a day or two.\nWhat's important is to make sure the baby doesn't dislike the 'experience of eating.'\n\nOnce the baby regains interest in food, they'll start "suddenly eating well" as if by promise 😊\nDon't be impatient; building a "joyful meal experience" is the answer.`;

Honestly... how could there not be.
The sound of a baby crying all day, spilled baby food, not napping,
and in the meantime, cooking and doing laundry.
When you see the quiet house after putting the baby to sleep, you think "Finally..." but then you worry about tomorrow. I know that feeling all too well 😔

🌤️ **1. It's enough to be a "good enough mom," not a "perfect mom"**

There's no such thing as perfect parenting.
A baby crying, not eating, waking up at night is not because mom did something wrong, but just a part of the baby's growth process.
It's okay to be a little less than perfect —
the fact that mom is enduring is love itself. 💖

🫖 **2. Make a very short 'me time'**

Even 10 minutes is fine.

Have a cup of coffee while the baby naps ☕

Listen to a song with earphones in 🎧

Open a window and take a deep breath of fresh air 🌿

That short 10 minutes gives you the strength to get through the day.
The key to stress relief is not "escape" but **"breathing."**

💬 **3. Be sure to 'voice' your feelings**

Parenting can be isolating.
So you need a space where you can say, "I'm having a hard time."
To your husband, to a friend, or to other moms with the same worries.
The moment you say it,
you feel a sense of relief, "I'm not the only one."

💞 **4. And also... come to the ToDoc community**

There, you'll find real moms who have struggled just like you today.
Someone talks about succeeding with baby food today,
someone talks about their baby who cried all night finally sleeping.

Sometimes, a single comment saying "Me too" is the biggest comfort. 🌙

❤️ **A word from Mom AI**

"Parenting is not something you do alone.
Me, you, all of us are learning as we endure a little at a time."

When things are tough, be sure to stop by ToDoc and leave even a small story.`;
